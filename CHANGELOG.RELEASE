- 2.0.1 | Feb 26 2026:
  [New] tlog_lib.sh: shared library for incremental log file reading with
      cursor-based position tracking
  [New] Multi-mode tracking: byte-offset (tail -c) and line-count (tail -n)
      modes selectable per call or via TLOG_MODE environment variable
  [New] Atomic cursor writes via mktemp + mv -f; cursor never empty during
      write operations
  [New] Optional flock-based cursor locking via TLOG_FLOCK=1 with 5-second
      timeout and structured exit code 4
  [New] Cursor validation with regex check; corrupt cursors auto-reset with
      exit code 2 and stderr warning
  [New] Mode-aware cursor format: bare number (bytes), L:N prefix (lines);
      mode mismatch detection with automatic reset
  [New] Rotation-aware delta reads: .1 and .1.gz rotated file discovery with
      bounds checking; .gz read via zcat pipe (never decompresses on disk)
  [New] Configurable first-run behavior via TLOG_FIRST_RUN: skip (default)
      outputs nothing, full outputs entire file
  [New] Journal functions: tlog_journal_filter (registry-based lookup),
      tlog_journal_register (service-to-filter registration primitive),
      tlog_journal_read (cursor-based with timestamp fallback),
      tlog_journal_read_full (no cursor, timeout support)
  [Change] Replace tlog_journal_filter() hardcoded case statement with
      indexed array registry; library contains zero project-specific
      service names
  [New] tlog_journal_register(name, filter): registration primitive for
      consuming projects to define service-to-journalctl filter mappings
  [Change] Journal filter registry uses parallel indexed arrays instead of
      declare -A to avoid scope issues when sourced from inside functions
  [New] BATS test suite: 74 tests covering both tracking modes, rotation,
      cursor validation, flock locking, atomic writes, journal, standalone CLI
  [New] Docker-based test infrastructure: Debian 12, Rocky 9, CentOS 6
      targets with parallel execution support
  [New] Cursor adjustment for log trim via tlog_adjust_cursor with mode
      detection and clamp-to-zero
  [New] Fast-forward multiple cursors via tlog_advance_cursors for file and
      journal sources
  [New] Stale protection: cursor mtime updated via touch on every tlog_read
      call regardless of output
  [New] Source guard via _TLOG_LIB_LOADED prevents double-sourcing
  [New] Structured error codes: 0 (success), 1 (file/path error), 2 (cursor
      corrupt), 3 (journal unavailable), 4 (lock failed)
  [New] Standalone tlog wrapper: CLI script sourcing tlog_lib.sh with
      backward-compatible argument parsing (file, tlog_name, optional mode)
  [New] Security check on tlog_lib.sh before sourcing: ownership (root)
      and permissions (not world-writable) validation
